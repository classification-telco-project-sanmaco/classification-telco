    "Why are our customers churning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions I have include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Could the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers))\n",
    "- Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?\n",
    "- Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?\n",
    "- If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I will also need a report (ipynb) answering the question, \"Why are our customers churning?\" I want to see the analysis you did to answer my questions and lead to your findings. Please clearly call out the questions and answers you are analyzing. E.g. If you find that month-to-month customers churn more, I won't be surprised, but I am not getting rid of that plan. The fact that they churn is not because they can, it's because they can and they are motivated to do so. I want some insight into why they are motivated to do so. I realize you will not be able to do a full causal experiment, but I hope to see some solid evidence of your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I will need you to deliver to me a csv with the customer_id, probability of churn, and the prediction of churn (1=churn, 0=not_churn). I would also like a single goolgle slide that illustrates how your model works, including the features being used, so that I can deliver this to the SLT when they come with questions about how these values were derived. Please make sure you include how likely your model is to give a high probability of churn when churn doesn't occur, to give a low probability of churn when churn occurs, and to accurately predict churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, our development team will need a .py file that will take in a new dataset, (in the exact same form of the one you acquired from telco_churn.customers) and perform all the transformations necessary to run the model you have developed on this new dataset to provide probabilities and predictions."

    "## Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed instructions for each section are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, make sure you document your work. You don't need to explain what every line of code is doing, but you should explain what and why you are doing. For example, if you drop a feature from the dataset, you should explain why you decided to do so, or why that is a reasonable thing to do. If you transform the data in a column, you should explain why you are making that transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you should not present numers in isolation. If your code outputs a number, be sure you give some context to the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a jupyter notebook where your work takes place\n",
    "- a csv file that predicts churn for each customer\n",
    "a python script that prepares data such that it can be fed into your model\n",
    "- a google slide summarizing your model\n",
    "- a README.md file that contains a link to your google slides presentation, and instructions for how to use your python script(s)"

    "### Acquisition\n",
    "1. Get the data from the customers table from the telco_churn database on the codeup data science database server.\n",
    "    - You may wish to join some tables as part of your query.\n",
    "    - This data should end up in a pandas data frame.\n",
    "2. Write a function, peekatdata(dataframe), that takes a dataframe as input and computes and returns the following:\n",
    "    - creates dataframe object head_df (df of the first 5 rows) and prints contents to screen\n",
    "    - creates dataframe object tail_df (df of the last 5 rows) and prints contents to screen\n",

    "        - should you remove the variable altogether?\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Could the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers)).\n",

    "3. Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?\n",

    "4. If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Controlling for services (phone_id, internet_service_type_id, online_security_backup, device_protection, tech_support, and contract_type_id), is the mean monthly_charges of those who have churned significantly different from that of those who have not churned? (Use a t-test to answer this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How much of monthly_charges can be explained by internet_service_type? (hint: correlation test). State your hypotheses and your conclusion clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How much of monthly_charges can be explained by internet_service_type + phone service type (0, 1, or multiple lines). State your hypotheses and your conclusion clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create visualizations exploring the interactions of variables (independent with independent and independent with dependent). The goal is to identify features that are related to churn, identify any data integrity issues, understand 'how the data works'. For example, we may find that all who have online services also have device protection. In that case, we don't need both of those. (The visualizations done in your analysis for questions 1-5 count towards the requirements below)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each independent variable (except for customer_id) should be visualized in at least two plots, and at least 1 of those compares the independent variable with the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For each plot where x and y are independent variables, add a third dimension (where possible), of churn represented by color.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use subplots when plotting the same type of chart but with different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Adjust the axes as necessary to extract information from the visualizations (adjusting the x & y limits, setting the scale where needed, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add annotations to at least 5 plots with a key takeaway from that plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use plots from matplotlib, pandas and seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - sns.heatmap\n",
    "        - pd.crosstab (along with sns.heatmap)\n",
    "        - pd.scatter_matrix\n",
    "        - sns.barplot\n",
    "        - sns.swarmplot\n",
    "        - sns.pairplot\n",
    "        - sns.jointplot\n",
    "        - sns.relplot or plt.scatter\n",
    "        - sns.distplot or plt.hist\n",
    "        - sns.boxplot\n",
    "        - plt.plot\n",
    "    - Use at least one more type of plot that is not included in the list above.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What can you say about each variable's relationship to churn, based on your initial exploration? If there appears to be some sort of interaction or correlation, assume there is no causal relationship and brainstorm (and document) ideas on reasons there could be correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Summarize your conclusions, provide clear answers to the specific questions, and summarize any takeaways/action plan from the work above."
